Audio Only Game Design Pitches
------------------------------

Humming Game - need to hum at the correct frequency - audio feedback based on resonant frequencies

Stealth game - monster maze (run from a dinosaur, need to be quiet when it's close)

Death Stranding - audio only version - mechanical baby apparatus moves/tells you where the monster is

Need to turn to friends and say "Hi"

Proteus but with no visual feedback - ambient music/audio sources that change based on player position and time of day

dystopian music choosing --- audio version of papers please

save the elephant game - if you do too much, the world is destroyed by aliens

text parser/typing game
audio only variation of patatap - https://patatap.com/

variations of Simon Says - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6p7zRsECaI

an anti-intuitive version of some audio game - inverting distance-volume relationships, and positional information

audio-only version of dark echo - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuOC8oTrFbM

non-human simulation (animals? androids?)

noisy house party exiting simulation - need to try to find the front door

picking a lock based on sound

hitting a fly - you are sleeping and a fly is buzzing around you (could do joycon version?)

Mechanics:
-- some kind of exaggerated echo location
-- call and response
-- taking audio input (microphone)
-- drastic environmental changes for games with continuous input
-- dodge-em-ups
-- using sound in a defensive way (throwing bottles to distract clickers)
