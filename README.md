WEEK 1 ASSIGNMENTS

Reading - [Seeing Circles Signs & Signals: “Intro, Signals & Sound” & “Sines & Sampling”](https://jackschaedler.github.io/circles-sines-signals/); please finish reading by Tuesday, September 10

Active Listening Response - with a partner, play a game from the provided list, [available here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1edCiqyz_i7B_XNmNsx9mYHWyKcveCXDQyfskvkeFy5Q/edit?usp=sharing), or make a case for a different game (do NOT watch a Let’s Play).  List every sound that you hear in the game.  How would you describe the overall audio aesthetic, mood, or feeling of the game?  What do you think are the most important sounds, and why?  How do sounds change in response to player action (some sounds may be randomized, or connected to in-game physics in interesting ways)?  Look up some facts about the creation of the game audio - what’s interesting about the techniques or technology used?

You will be presenting a brief (~7 minute) presentation during a lab time, at some point in the semester. 

For Friday’s Lab section, bring in 3 sounds from a game project that you’ve worked on.
