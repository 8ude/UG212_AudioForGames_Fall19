# NYU UG212_AudioForGames_Fall19
Repo for the 2019 class of audio for digital games

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/8ude/UG212_AudioForGames_Fall19/wiki) for Syllabus, Helpful Links, and Assignment Details

WEEK 2 ASSIGNMENTS
------

Reading - the reading from week 1 is posted on the syllabus.  You don't need to revisit it, if you think you understood it the first time.  The Transforms and Notations section has some interactive Fourier transform things, but I personally like this website better (courtesy of Mai) - http://www.jezzamon.com/fourier/index.html

Sound Collage - Create a 3-5 minute “story” (whatever that means to you) using samples sourced from the Audio for Digital Games Library or Freesound.org.  Experiment with different sample rates, bit depths, and sculpting using filters and EQ. [Render and upload your Sound Collages here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RujiXd8HTTlCmF6821k2iVFov2_y94d1?usp=sharing) when you're done!

Also, Mai posted this in the Slack - https://learningsynths.ableton.com

Try going through it!  We're going to be doing a bit with synthesis in Reaper, but this is a much more fun walkthrough.



WEEK 1 ASSIGNMENTS
------

Reading - [Seeing Circles Signs & Signals: “Intro, Signals & Sound” & “Sines & Sampling”](https://jackschaedler.github.io/circles-sines-signals/); please finish reading by Tuesday, September 10

Active Listening Response - with a partner, play a game from the provided list, [available here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1edCiqyz_i7B_XNmNsx9mYHWyKcveCXDQyfskvkeFy5Q/edit?usp=sharing), or make a case for a different game (do NOT watch a Let’s Play).  List every sound that you hear in the game.  How would you describe the overall audio aesthetic, mood, or feeling of the game?  What do you think are the most important sounds, and why?  How do sounds change in response to player action (some sounds may be randomized, or connected to in-game physics in interesting ways)?  Look up some facts about the creation of the game audio - what’s interesting about the techniques or technology used?

You will be presenting a brief (~7 minute) presentation during a lab time, at some point in the semester. 

For Friday’s Lab section, bring in 3 sounds from a game project that you’ve worked on.
