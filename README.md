WEEK 3 ASSIGNMENT
------

[Choose 3 animated gifs from this directory](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KtKVr2g5EDVzZFDWw0WlUdZo5YfYev41).  If you want, you can find or make your own, provided that it is roughly 10 seconds long and contains a significant amount of motion.

Add sound effects to accompany the gifs.  The goal for the first pass is to have a distinct sound for every distinct motion - try to make it believable, as if the motions in the gif are producing the sound. 

Then, do a "second pass."  Choose different source material, and take a different artistic direction.  Try to still have sound for almost every motion. 

Render these as WEBM videos and [upload them here when you're done](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_NTeqrtVU8Dj2K09JdBUYNX1nlUfO-sr?usp=sharing).  Make a sub-folder with your name   

WEEK 2 ASSIGNMENTS

Reading - the reading from week 1 is posted on the syllabus.  You don't need to revisit it, if you think you understood it the first time.  The Transforms and Notations section has some interactive Fourier transform things, but I personally like this website better (courtesy of Mai) - http://www.jezzamon.com/fourier/index.html

Sound Collage - Create a 3-5 minute “story” (whatever that means to you) using samples sourced from the Audio for Digital Games Library or Freesound.org.  Experiment with different sample rates, bit depths, and sculpting using filters and EQ. [Render and upload your Sound Collages here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RujiXd8HTTlCmF6821k2iVFov2_y94d1?usp=sharing) when you're done!

Also, Mai posted this in the Slack - https://learningsynths.ableton.com

Try going through it!  We're going to be doing a bit with synthesis in Reaper, but this is a much more fun walkthrough.



WEEK 1 ASSIGNMENTS
------

Reading - [Seeing Circles Signs & Signals: “Intro, Signals & Sound” & “Sines & Sampling”](https://jackschaedler.github.io/circles-sines-signals/); please finish reading by Tuesday, September 10

Active Listening Response - with a partner, play a game from the provided list, [available here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1edCiqyz_i7B_XNmNsx9mYHWyKcveCXDQyfskvkeFy5Q/edit?usp=sharing), or make a case for a different game (do NOT watch a Let’s Play).  List every sound that you hear in the game.  How would you describe the overall audio aesthetic, mood, or feeling of the game?  What do you think are the most important sounds, and why?  How do sounds change in response to player action (some sounds may be randomized, or connected to in-game physics in interesting ways)?  Look up some facts about the creation of the game audio - what’s interesting about the techniques or technology used?

You will be presenting a brief (~7 minute) presentation during a lab time, at some point in the semester. 

For Friday’s Lab section, bring in 3 sounds from a game project that you’ve worked on.
